  This package handles the conversion of VectorMaps etc. to and from
  encoded representation (i.e., (mimetype,binary) pairs).

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  Typical use for decoding a value into an object:
  <ol>
    <li>ActivationUtil.decode() is called with a DataSource.

    <li>(If the target representation type is one of the trivial ones:
      DataSource, InputStream and byte[], these are handled
      directly. Otherwise, proceed.)

    <li>The content type of the DataSource is consulted, and a
      corresponding DataContentHandler is found.
      <br>
      For all protocol buffer encoded data (mimetype
      "application/x-protobuf"), for instance, this is
      ProtobufDataContentHandler.

    <li>The DataContentHandler decodes the object.
      <br>
      For instance, a DataSource with a mimetype of
      "application/x-protobuf;proto=vectormap" will be decoded into a
      VectorMap instance.
  </ol>
